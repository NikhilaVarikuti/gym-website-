<h3>Treadmill</h3>
<p style="font-family: Garamond, serif;font-size:130%;">When you have osteoarthritis, exercise can make you stronger, improve your balance, and lessen knee pain. Walking is an easy, low-impact way to start working out. A treadmill allows you to stay active and walk no matter the weather and does not make your joints move much differently than if you were outside.</p><br>

                <p style="font-family: Garamond, serif;font-size:130%;">Weight training, also known as resistance or strength training, builds lean, stronger muscles, strengthens your bones and joints, and can help keep your metabolism in a healthy state - meaning you will burn more calories even when you are resting.

And the benefits of lifting weights are not just for young people. Weight training as we age can help fight the loss of muscle mass and mobility, as well as improve psychological well-being.</p>
