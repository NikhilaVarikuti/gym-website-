<h1 style="font-family: Garamond, serif;font-size:180%;text-align:center;color:#5C4E4E;">Diet to be followed</h1>
<p style="font-family: Garamond, serif;font-size:130%;">Get ready to start keeping track of calories and macronutrients. You do not need to be meticulous, but you do need to be consistent.</p>
<p style="font-family: Garamond, serif;font-size:130%;">If your goal is to gain muscle size and maximize strength, consume 14-18 calories per pound of your body weight. For fat loss, go with 10-12 calories per pound. Yes, these are ranges and not exact numbers-you will need to experiment a bit and find what works for you.</p>
<p style="font-family: Garamond, serif;font-size:130%;">Start on the lower end of the spectrum for muscle gain and the higher end for fat loss, so that changes can be made gradually, and adjust if you are not gaining or losing weight after two weeks.</p>
<p style="font-family: Garamond, serif;font-size:130%;">When bulking up or slimming down, your protein and fat intake should be very similar. Eat 1-1.5 grams of protein per pound of your body weight and 0.4 gram of fat per pound.</p>
<p style="font-family: Garamond, serif;font-size:130%;">Carbohydrates have the greatest effect on body weight due to their impact on insulin, a hormone that alternately causes muscle or fat gain depending on the timing and composition of your meals. For this reason, the amount of carbs you eat will vary greatly depending on your goal.</p>
